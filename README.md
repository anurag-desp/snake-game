# Snake Game
- Snake game is like a "Hello World" program for someone who has some experience in coding.
- So, here is my version of the snake game written in C
- Things I learned while doing this project are in the file [learnings.md](https://github.com/Anurag404OpenSourceRules/snake-game/blob/main/learnings.md).
- I've tried to keep it as raw as I possibly could. Meaning, I wanted to challenge myself to not use any **dedicated library** for the game specifically.
> Yes, I know I've used some built in ones, like `stdio.h`, `time.h`, `unistd.h`, `stdlib.h` and a user defined one called `kbhit.h` (I shamelessly stole it from github).
